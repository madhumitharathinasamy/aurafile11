                <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that simple tasks like resizing an image or converting a file format shouldn't require downloading heavy software, registering for an account, or risking your privacy by uploading files to unknown servers.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    Our mission is to build the web's best collection of file utility tools that work <strong>entirely in your browser</strong>. This ensures:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your files never leave your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Zero upload/download times for processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Works on any device with a modern web browser.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Why Browser-Based?</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional online tools upload your files to a cloud server to process them. This is slow, requires internet bandwidth, and raises privacy concerns. By leveraging modern web technologies like WebAssembly and the Canvas API, AuraFile brings desktop-class performance directly to your browser tab.
                </p>
