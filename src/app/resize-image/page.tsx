            answer: "It depends. Reducing dimensions usually maintains quality. Enlarging images may cause pixelation, but we use high-quality algorithms (lanczos/bicubic) to minimize this effect."
        },
        {
            question: "What formats are supported?",

            question: "How do I resize for Instagram?",

        },
        {
            question: "Are my images uploaded to a server?",
            answer: "No. All resizing happens locally in your browser using modern WebAssembly and Canvas APIs. Your files never leave your device."
