                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    In today’s digital era, ensuring the privacy and security of your sensitive documents is paramount.
                    Unlike traditional cloud-based services that demand you upload your private files to an external server,
                    our advanced PDF encryption tool operates 100% locally within your browser.
                    This means your files never leave your device, representing the gold standard in data security.

                    <p className="">
                        Traditional online PDF protectors work by asking you to upload your PDF to their server,
                        where the encryption is applied, and then you download the result. This introduces significant risk:
                        your file is transmitted over the internet, temporarily stored on a server, and exposed to potential
                        interception. Our tool downloads the encryption engine to your browser instead, applying the password
                        locally using JavaScript and Web Assembly.

                        By applying robust standard encryption keys, your document is mathematically sealed. Even if a malicious
                        actor gains access to your local machine&apos;s raw file, they cannot bypass the cryptographic lock without
                        the exact password string you provided during the locking process.

                        strategies, sending an unprotected PDF as an email attachment is akin to sending a postcard. Anyone who intercepts
                        it can read the contents. Password protection adds an essential layer of security.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    The strength of your PDF encryption is only as robust as the password you select.
                    A cryptographic lock can withstand brute-force attacks from supercomputers for millennia,
                    but if your password is &quot;password123&quot;, human error becomes the vulnerability.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Instead of random strings of characters that are impossible to remember (like `Xy7!pQ9$m`),
                    we recommend the <strong>Diceware method</strong> or utilizing a <strong>Passphrase</strong>.
                    A passphrase consists of four to five random, unconnected words (e.g., `BatteryHorseStapleCorrect`).
                    It is mathematically incredibly difficult for a computer algorithm to guess, yet extremely easy
                    for the human brain to visualize and remember.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Disclaimer: Because our tool operates 100% locally and stores absolutely zero data, we do not
                    have a &quot;forgot password&quot; feature. If you forget your PDF password, the document is lost forever.
                    Always keep a backup or store your passwords in a secure, audited Password Manager.

                    Why Merge PDFs?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the universal language of business communication.
                    However, organizing multiple PDFs can become chaotic. Imagine receiving five different invoices
                    from a freelancer, a cover letter and a resume as separate files, or distinct chapters of a book
                    submitted by different authors. Merging these files into one single document brings order to chaos.

                <p>
                    Most web-based PDF combiners rely on cloud processing. This means your private files—potentially containing
                    bank details, confidential corporate roadmaps, or personal ID cards—are sent to a remote server.
                    Once processed, the combined file is sent back.

                <p>
                    <strong>AuraFile takes a radically different approach.</strong> We leverage the modern web technology known as
                    Web Assembly (Wasm) and HTML5 APIs to download the logic directly into your browser.

                <p>
                    If you are merging massive architectural blueprints or extremely high-resolution image portfolios,
                    the resulting merged PDF might be larger than typical email attachment limits (usually 25MB).
                    When working with heavy documents, we highly recommend using our <strong>Compress PDF</strong> tool
                    after merging. The compression tool uses intelligent structural optimization to strip out unused
                    objects and rasterize extreme DPI images down to a manageable size, often resulting in an 80% smaller file size
                    with zero visible quality loss.
